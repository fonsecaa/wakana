Little machine that randomly generates chords and a melody
Andres Fonseca

In the interest of exploring where melodies and "effective" or "human-sounding" music comes from, 
I wrote a little program than randomly generates a chord progression and melody (within a key).

In part, to explore what are the fewest assumptions I have to make before a computer starts writing music
I enjoy but also so that as I add rules and preferences I can study which combination of assumptions leads
to different kinds of music.

Feel free to run "java Tune" for a minute of soothing randomness.
